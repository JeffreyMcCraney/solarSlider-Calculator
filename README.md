# solarSlider-Calculator

This is a project I'm doing for Vivint Solar to create a slider adjuster that calculates 20-year savings based on location and power company in the United States.

Kudos to RangeSlider and @andreruffert for doing the hard work with making such a beautiful slider. I'm new to Git/Github so please forgive any mistakes!
